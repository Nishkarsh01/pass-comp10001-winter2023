#1. Numbers in Python and how to use them.
#We'll learn about the following topics:
#1.) Types of Numbers in Python
#2.) Basic Arithmetic
#3.) Differences between classic division and floor division
#4.) Object Assignment in Python

print("Hello World")

# Addition
2+1
#3

# Subtraction
2-1
#1

# Multiplication
2*2
4
# Division
3/2
#1.5

# Floor Division
7//4

# Modulo
7%4

# Powers
2**3

# Can also do roots this way
4**0.5

# Order of Operations followed in Python: #BEDMAS
2 + 10 * 10 + 3


#2. Variable Assignments
#Now that we've seen how to use numbers in Python as a calculator let's see how we can assign names and create variables.
#We use a single equals sign to assign labels to variables. Let's see a few examples of how we can do this.

# Let's create an object called "a" and assign it the number 5
a = 5

# Adding the objects
a+a

# Reassignment
a = 10


# Use object names to keep better track of what's going on in your code!
my_income = 100
tax_rate = 0.1
my_taxes = my_income*tax_rate
