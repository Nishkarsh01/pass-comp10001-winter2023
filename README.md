# PASS COMP10001-Winter2023
Every Saturday there is a PASS session organized by me for COMP 10001 students with the focus on helping them understand the basics of python programming language. Throughout the winter2023 semester during these sessions, we will put our knowledge to test by developing some projects; projects that will also help students build their portfolio.
