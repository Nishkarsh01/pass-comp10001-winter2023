# Learning Python with Rock, Paper, Scissors

By creating this program, you can learn some of the basics of programming in Python, which can be applied to many other programs and projects.

## How the Program Works
The program works as follows:
1. The program defines the game options (rock, paper, and scissors) and the rules of the game (i.e., which option beats which).
2. The program prompts the user to choose an option (rock, paper, or scissors) and validates the input to ensure it's a valid option.
3. The program generates a random option for the computer.
4. The program compares the user's option and the computer's option to determine the winner based on the rules of the game.
5. The program displays the results of the game.
## How it Can Help You in Your Programming Journey
This program can help you in your programming journey in a number of ways:
## Understanding basic programming concepts
By building this program, you'll get practice working with some of the most fundamental programming concepts, including:
- Variables: The program uses variables to define the game options, the rules of the game, and the user and computer's choices.
- User input: The program uses the `input` function to get user input and validate it to make sure it's a valid choice.
- Conditional statements: The program uses `if-else` statements to determine the winner of the game based on the user and computer's choices and the rules of the game.
- Randomness: The program uses the `random` module to generate a random choice for the computer.
- Functions: The program defines a function to handle the game logic, which makes the code more organized and easier to read.
- Print statements: The program uses `print` statements to display the results of the game.

## Improving your problem-solving skills

As you build this program, you'll need to think through how to solve a complex problem in a logical and efficient way. This can help you develop your problem-solving skills, which are essential for programming and many other fields.
## Building confidence in your programming abilities
By successfully building a program like this, you'll gain confidence in your programming abilities and be motivated to continue learning and building more complex programs.
