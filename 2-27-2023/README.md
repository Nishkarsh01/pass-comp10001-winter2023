# Learning Python with Rock, Paper, Scissors

This is a simple Python program that allows you to play rock, paper, scissors against the computer. It can help you learn some important concepts in Python, including:

- **Variables**: The program uses variables to define the game options (rock, paper, and scissors), the rules of the game, and the user and computer's choices.
- **User input**: The program uses the `input` function to get user input and validate it to make sure it's a valid choice.
- **Conditional statements**: The program uses `if-else` statements to determine the winner of the game based on the user and computer's choices and the rules of the game.
- **Randomness**: The program uses the `random` module to generate a random choice for the computer.
- **Functions**: The program defines a function to handle the game logic, which makes the code more organized and easier to read.
- **Print statements**: The program uses `print` statements to display the results of the game.

By creating this program, you can learn some of the basics of programming in Python, which can be applied to many other programs and projects.
